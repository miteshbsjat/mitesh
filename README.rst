Introduction
************

``MiteSh`` is a very simple wrapper over `subprocess <https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html>`_ :) .
It enables us to run any POSIX shell (one-liner) in python and provides output line by line through generator.

``MiteSh`` is:

- **tiny:** The current source code has 164 lines of code (with about 35% documentation) and 114 lines of test.
- **written in pure Python:**   MiteSh neither needs an external server  nor any dependencies from PyPI.
- **works on Python 3.6+ and PyPy3:** MiteSh works on all modern versions of Python and PyPy.
- **powerfully extensible:** You can easily extend ``MiteSh`` to more shells, currently tested with 
  - sh
  - bash
  - zsh


Supported Python Versions
*************************

MiteSh has been tested with Python 3.6+ and PyPy3.


Supported Operating Systems
***************************

``MiteSh`` should run on all \*NIX Operating Systems. Like:

- GNU/Linux
- UNIX \*BSD
- Mac OS (Darwin)


Examples
********

Run Hello World
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from mitesh import MiteSh
    >>> for line in MiteSh("echo Hello World").execute():
    ...     print(line)
    ... 
    Hello World


Get Number of CPU Cores in Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    >>> for line in MiteSh("cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep \"cpu cores\" | uniq | cut -d: -f2 | sed 's/ //g'").execute():
    ...     print(line)
    ... 
    6

The above command was run on ``Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10750H CPU @ 2.60GHz``


Using Different Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    >>> for line in MiteSh("echo hello", sh_type="sh").execute():
    ...     print(line)
    ... 
    hello
    >>> for line in MiteSh("ps", sh_type="sh").execute():
    ...     print(line)
    ... 
        PID TTY          TIME CMD

    102811 pts/5    00:00:00 sh
    102812 pts/5    00:00:00 ps
    >>> for line in MiteSh("ps", sh_type="zsh").execute():
    ...     print(line)
    ... 
        PID TTY          TIME CMD
    51839 pts/5    00:00:00 bash
    91559 pts/5    00:00:00 python3
    103035 pts/5    00:00:00 zsh
    103036 pts/5    00:00:00 ps

Also, I would like to thank God, my Teachers, my Parents, my Wife and Daughter to stand with me all the times.
